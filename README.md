Introduction:

My first attempt to hackintosh project, the dnk version of Nuc is the business version so I have yet find a tutorial for hackintosh. Then I decided to do it by myself. The set up was completed through clover and I installed necessary drives include GPU, Bluetooth, Wifi later after entering the system. I hope this could help other who using the same version computer as me and want to install hackintosh.
